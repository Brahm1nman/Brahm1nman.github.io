					<h2>This is starting to consume my life</h2>
					<p>	I got up early all weekend to work on this little project (i.e. learning HTML and CSS, I'm building as I learn). Now it's what I'm doing after work instead of relaxing! I do not work in tech, I work in construction, but I'd like to change that!. So this is the start of my journey down the full-stack developer roadmap on <a href="https://roadmap.sh/full-stack">roadmap.sh</a>.</p>
					<p>	I've always had a burning interest in all things tech. I've attemped many projects on raspberry pi, run lots of game servers for my friends, built my gaming PC (turned workstation) and just generally been a massive nerd entire life. So this is really a long time coming.</p>
					<p>	That's what I've got for an intro at this time! As a final note, I'm using <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/'>"Jekyll"</a> to run this site on <a href='https://pages.github.com/'>"Github Pages".</a></p>
