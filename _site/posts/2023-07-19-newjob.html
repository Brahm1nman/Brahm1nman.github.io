			<p> Welcome to the Pasture! I'm building this site to showcase my personal projects. I don't know what all that will be just yet, but I'll put up blog posts to accompany everything. So building the blog is first and I think I wanna do something to embed my Mastodon feed.</p>

					<h1> Is this blogging? I think I'm blogging!</h1>
						<p> Here's a quick personal update! I think this makes me a blogger now!</p>

					<h2> I got a new job!</h2>
					<p> I was offered a new job today, which I'm super excited about. I haven't really felt great about myself in my current position and that's really been weighing on me for a long time. So I'm really excited for a fresh start and it's way more my speed, working with my hands and fixing things full-time!</p>
					<p>This is also going to offer me a lot more time to work on my projects, since it's a 4/10 schedule, I'll have all weekend for family time and still have a whole day to work in an empty house!</p>
					<p>That's all for today, here's to the future everyone!</p>
